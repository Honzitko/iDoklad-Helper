# Assessment of iDoklad Invoice Processor Plugin Requirements

After reviewing the repository contents, the plugin described in the requirements is not present. The repository is currently empty aside from Git metadata. None of the expected files, directories, or documentation exist.

## Missing Project Structure
- The main plugin bootstrap file `idoklad-invoice-processor.php` is absent.
- Supporting files such as `uninstall.php` and all classes within the `includes/` directory are missing.
- No `templates/` directory or templates (`admin-settings.php`, `admin-users.php`, `admin-logs.php`) are provided.
- No `assets/` directory containing `admin.css` or `admin.js` exists.

## Missing Documentation
- Required documentation files (`README.md`, `INSTALLATION.md`, `USER_MANUAL.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) are not present.

## Functional Gaps
Given the lack of code, none of the advertised functionality is implemented:
- No WordPress hooks for activation/deactivation or cron scheduling.
- No email processing, PDF parsing, ChatGPT integration, or iDoklad API communication.
- No admin interface, user management, logging, or notification systems.

## Conclusion
The repository does not contain the WordPress plugin described in the requirements. Substantial implementation work is needed to meet even the basic project structure and functionality expectations.
